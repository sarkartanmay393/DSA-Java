## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that help in solving complex problems efficiently. This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of various data structures and algorithms using the Java programming language. Some code file is accompanied by detailed explanation texts that describe the underlying concepts, the approach used, and the time and space complexity analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Java.git
   ```

2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

3. Browse the repository and explore the different folders to find the data structures and algorithms you are interested in.

4. Open the Java files in your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor.

5. Read the accompanying explanation texts to understand the concepts and approach behind each implementation.

6. Run the Java files to see the algorithms in action and experiment with different inputs.

## Data Structures

This repository covers a wide range of data structures, including but not limited to:

- Array

- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
<!-- - Heap
- Hash Table
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Graph -->

Some data structure implementation is provided as a separate Java file, accompanied by an explanation text that describes its properties, operations, and use cases.

## Algorithms

The repository includes various algorithm implementations that demonstrate efficient solutions for different problem domains. Some of the algorithms covered are:

- Searching
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
- Sorting
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  <!-- - Graph Algorithms
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Kruskal's Algorithm
  - Prim's Algorithm -->

Some algorithm implementation is provided as a separate Java file, along with a comprehensive explanation text that describes its working principle, time complexity, and relevant use cases.
